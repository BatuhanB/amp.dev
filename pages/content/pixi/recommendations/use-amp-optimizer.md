AMP pages are not always served from an AMP Cache. Instead, a website may send
AMP pages from its own servers. In these cases, it's important to make sure
your AMP pages offer the optimal loading performance. Use an 
[AMP Optimizer](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/optimize-and-measure/amp-optimizer-guide/)
to improve the loading performance of your AMP pages when served from the origin!
